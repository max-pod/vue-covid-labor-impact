# Disparity by Education

The Pandemic has disparately affected different education levels. Our
classification follows the ONET Jobzone classification system.[^10]

[^10]: See Job Zones https://www.onetonline.org/help/online/zones

| Job Zone 1 | Some of these occupations may require a high school diploma or GED certificate.                                                                           | Little or no previous work-related skill, knowledge, or experience is needed for these occupations. For example, a person can become a waiter or waitress even if he/she has never worked before.                                                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Job Zone 2 | These occupations usually require a high school diploma.                                                                                                  | Some previous work-related skill, knowledge, or experience is usually needed. For example, a teller would benefit from experience working directly with the public.                                                                                                                               |
| Job Zone 3 | Most occupations in this zone require training in vocational schools, related on-the-job experience, or an associate's degree.                            | Previous work-related skill, knowledge, or experience is required for these occupations. For example, an electrician must have completed three or four years of apprenticeship or several years of vocational training, and often must have passed a licensing exam, in order to perform the job. |
| Job Zone 4 | Most of these occupations require a four-year bachelor's degree, but some do not.                                                                         | A considerable amount of work-related skill, knowledge, or experience is needed for these occupations. For example, an accountant must complete four years of college and work for several years in accounting to be considered qualified.                                                        |
| Job Zone 5 | Most of these occupations require graduate school. For example, they may require a master's degree, and some require a Ph.D., M.D., or J.D. (law degree). | Extensive skill, knowledge, and experience are needed for these occupations. Many require more than five years of experience. For example, surgeons must complete four years of college and an additional five to seven years of specialized medical training to be able to do their job.         |

We follow TrackTheRecovery's example in combining Job Zone 1 and 2 as 'Low
Level' and the rest as 'High Level.' [^11]

## Job Postings by Education

Interestingly, lower-level job postings recovered faster than higher level
postings. That may be, however, due to lower-income families losing and then
regaining their jobs, while higher-income families were less likely to lose
their jobs.
