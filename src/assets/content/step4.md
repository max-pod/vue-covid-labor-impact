# Disparity by Income

The next several slides compare how different income groups experienced the
pandemic effects. Low Income is categorized as below \$27k, Middle at
\$27k-\$60k, and High above \$60k. [^7] Also, most charts will index in Feb 2020
as the first U.S. Covid-19 case.

## Employment by Income

The Fed Listens Events, held in 2019, backed a widely stipulated academic
theory, where disadvantaged groups disproportionally benefit from hiring
near-maximum unemployment. [^8] The opposite is equally valid. As pointed by
Cajner, "Blacks have substantially higher and more cyclical unemployment rates
than whites, and observable characteristics can explain very little of this
differential, which is importantly driven by a comparatively higher risk of job
loss." [^9]

The chart to the left sources compiled data from TrackTheRecovery and
demonstrates this risk during the Pandemic. Three trends can be extrapolated:

**First, lower-income groups experienced job losses slightly earlier.**
Lower-income groups lost out on employment gains during March, while both other
groups still experienced gains.

**Second, lower-income groups faced more severe effects.** These groups
experienced bottomed at -35% change, while middle and upper classes faced -23%
and -13%, respectively.

**Third, lower-income groups have not recovered.** Higher-income individuals
have experienced practically unchanged employment since July, while lower-income
individuals still sit around 16% employment loss.
