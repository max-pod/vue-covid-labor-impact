# Concluding

*There may have been some disparity caused by the Pandemic.*

The Pandemic has yet to end, and the full ramifications of it are unknown. At
the time of writing, October 7th, new confirmed cases have remained at 30k new
cases over a seven-day moving average.

However, without a doubt, income groups faced a large disparity in various
shocks.

**Lower Income resulted in:**

1.  Experiencing more severe and long-lasting unemployment

2.  Most Unchanged Spending

3.  Most Immense Detrimental Shock to Education

4.  Low-Level Job Postings Increased

Further updates to this paper will begin estimating whether employment recovery
will sustain a recovery pace or will stall out.
