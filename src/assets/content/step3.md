## Powerful Fiscal Policy Response

Fiscal Policy, or actions taken by Congress, has three main tools: taxation,
subsidies, and discretionary fiscal policy. For the most part, this section will
focus on discretionary fiscal policy, which has played a vital role during the
Pandemic.

When compared to the 2007 response, Fiscal Support has been remarkable. The
chart on the right queries Current Government Expenditures (FGEXPND). April 1st
represents a 92% percent increase from last year as a proxy of the increase in
government expenditures due to the Pandemic.

As the chart illustrates, this increase is massive relative to regular
expenditures. That said, many Central Bankers are appealing for additional
fiscal stimulus. For example, on October 6th, Chair Powell warned of "At this
early stage, I would argue that the risks of policy intervention are still
asymmetric. Too little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating
unnecessary hardship." [^1]

A chorus of other central bankers has been affirming this view. The September
Minutes, for example, stresses "if future fiscal support was significantly
smaller or arrived significantly later than they expected, the pace of the
recovery could be slower than anticipated." [^2]

Officials such as Philadelphia Fed's President Harker, Chicago Fed's President
Evans, New York Fed's President Williams, have all noted that forecasts of a
recovery hinged on fiscal policy. The sole exception within U.S. central banking
officials seems to be the Saint Louis Fed President Bullard, "Even if you don't
do that [pass a new package of fiscal policy], I think the same dynamic will
play out." [^3]

Fed officials lobbying for fiscal support is highly unusual when taken in the
context of central bank independence. [^4] The Boston Fed President Rosengren
points out that central bank independence is a form of "instrument independence"
but not "goal independence." [^5] This lobbying speaks volumes when, as pointed
out by the ECB, central bank independence is already under pressure, especially
for the U.S. [^6]
