## COVID Uniquely Disrupted the Labor Market

The Pandemic posed a remarkable shock to the U.S. economy, unmatched in impact
by any prior recession. The chart on the right queries FRED for PAYEMS, which
represents total nonfarm payroll. According to the St. Louis Fed, this
approximates 80% of the workers who contribute to GDP.

The chart exposes three significant insights.

**First, no other recession in the last 70 years matches the severity of the
Pandemic.** In % job losses relative to the peak, the Pandemic is nearly three
times as dramatic as the 2007 financial crash.

**Second, and even more concerning, the recovery has been slowing.** If this
trend continues, the latter half of the recovery can meet the 2007 recovery
pace, which took over 2200 days to recover lost jobs fully.

**Third, labor markets have recovered slower relative to every new recession.**
Prior to 1981, the recovery time ranged between \~200 to \~600 days. The 1981 to
2001 labor market recoveries took about: 800 days, 1300 days, and 2200 days.
