## COVID Uniquely Disrupted the Labor Market

The Pandemic posed a remarkable shock to the U.S. economy, unmatched in impact
by any prior recession. The chart on the right queries FRED for PAYEMS, which
represents total nonfarm payroll. According to the St. Louis Fed, this
approximates 80% of the workers who contribute to GDP.

The chart exposes three significant insights.

**First, no other recession in the last 70 years matches the severity of the
Pandemic.** In % job losses relative to the peak, the Pandemic is nearly three
times as dramatic as the 2007 financial crash.

**Second, and even more concerning, the recovery has been slowing.** If this
trend continues, the latter half of the recovery can meet the 2007 recovery
pace, which took over 2200 days to recover lost jobs fully.

**Third, labor markets have recovered slower relative to every new recession.**
Prior to 1981, the recovery time ranged between \~200 to \~600 days. The 1981 to
2001 labor market recoveries took about: 800 days, 1300 days, and 2200 days.

## Despite Powerful Monetary Policy

Monetary Policy has four main tools: The Fed Funds Rate, Interest on Reserves,
Open Market Operations, and the 13(3) Lending Facilities.

The extraordinary scale of this Pandemic has prompted an extraordinary response
from the Federal Reserve. The chart on the left queries FRED for Federal Debt
Held by Federal Reserve Banks as Percent of Gross Domestic Product
(HBFRGDQ188S).

This chart illustrates the scale of action and quickness of action. The Fed has
unleashed a host of lending facilities, large scale asset purchases, dollar swap
lines both as a response of flight-to-quality and call for stability. This
mostly results in the expansion of the balance sheet, where the Fed holds more
debt.

Compared to the Financial Crisis of 2007, monetary policy action can be
concluded to have been released in one massive burst, around March. More so, the
pandemic policy action has been more expansive than the 2007 response. Programs
such as the TALF, MMLF, CPFF, and PDCFF have made a resurgence, along with the
newly made MLF, MSLF, PPPLF, CCF. This expansion of tools targets varied groups,
from municipalities to medium-sized businesses.

At the same time, the depth of the response dramatically increased. QE1 in 2008
purchased GSE of \$100 billion, and MBS of \$500 billion. Contrasted, the Fed
initially claimed it would buy at least \$500 billion in Treasury securities and
\$200 billion in government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities before
revising the statement to "the amounts needed to support smooth market
functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial
conditions."

## Despite Powerful Fiscal Policy

Fiscal Policy, or actions taken by Congress, has three main tools: taxation,
subsidies, and discretionary fiscal policy. For the most part, this section will
focus on discretionary fiscal policy, which has played a vital role during the
Pandemic.

When compared to the 2007 response, Fiscal Support has been remarkable. The
chart on the right queries Current Government Expenditures (FGEXPND). April 1st
represents a 92% percent increase from last year as a proxy of the increase in
government expenditures due to the Pandemic.

As the chart illustrates, this increase is massive relative to regular
expenditures. That said, many Central Bankers are appealing for additional
fiscal stimulus. For example, on October 6th, Chair Powell warned of "At this
early stage, I would argue that the risks of policy intervention are still
asymmetric. Too little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating
unnecessary hardship." [^1]

[^1]: See “Fed’s Powell Says U.S. Faces ‘Tragic’ Risks From Doing Too Little to
    Support Economy “ (Timiraos, 2020)
    https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-powell-says-u-s-faces-tragic-risks-from-doing-too-little-to-support-economy-11601995201?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=10

A chorus of other central bankers has been affirming this view. The September
Minutes, for example, stresses "if future fiscal support was significantly
smaller or arrived significantly later than they expected, the pace of the
recovery could be slower than anticipated." [^2]

[^2]: See September Minutes (Fed, 2020)
    https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20200916.pdf

Officials such as Philadelphia Fed's President Harker, Chicago Fed's President
Evans, New York Fed's President Williams, have all noted that forecasts of a
recovery hinged on fiscal policy. The sole exception within U.S. central banking
officials seems to be the Saint Louis Fed President Bullard, "Even if you don't
do that [pass a new package of fiscal policy], I think the same dynamic will
play out." [^3]

    Vary” (Derby, 2020)

Fed officials lobbying for fiscal support is highly unusual when taken in the
context of central bank independence. [^4] The Boston Fed President Rosengren
points out that central bank independence is a form of "instrument independence"
but not "goal independence." [^5] This lobbying speaks volumes when, as pointed
out by the ECB, central bank independence is already under pressure, especially
for the U.S. [^6]

# Disparity by Income

The next several slides compare how different income groups experienced the
pandemic effects. Low Income is categorized as below \$27k, Middle at
\$27k-\$60k, and High above \$60k. [^7] Also, most charts will index in Feb 2020
as the first U.S. Covid-19 case.

    Built from Private Sector Data” (Chetty et. al, 2020)
    https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tracker_paper.pdf

## Employment by Income

The Fed Listens Events, held in 2019, backed a widely stipulated academic
theory, where disadvantaged groups disproportionally benefit from hiring
near-maximum unemployment. [^8] The opposite is equally valid. As pointed by
Cajner, "Blacks have substantially higher and more cyclical unemployment rates
than whites, and observable characteristics can explain very little of this
differential, which is importantly driven by a comparatively higher risk of job
loss." [^9]

[^8]: See “Fed Listens: Perspectives on Maximum Employment and Price Stability”
    (FED Board, 2019)
    https://www.federalreserve.gov/conferences/fed-listens-perspectives-on-maximum-employment-and-price-stability.htm

    over the Business Cycle” (Cajner et. al, 2017)
    https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2017071pap.pdf

The chart to the left sources compiled data from TrackTheRecovery and
demonstrates this risk during the Pandemic. Three trends can be extrapolated:

**First, lower-income groups experienced job losses slightly earlier.**
Lower-income groups lost out on employment gains during March, while both other
groups still experienced gains.

**Second, lower-income groups faced more severe effects.** These groups
experienced bottomed at -35% change, while middle and upper classes faced -23%
and -13%, respectively.

**Third, lower-income groups have not recovered.** Higher-income individuals
have experienced practically unchanged employment since July, while lower-income
individuals still sit around 16% employment loss.

## Spending by Income

On the flip side, while lower-income individuals were more likely to lose their
jobs, their spending habits were the least impacted due to the Pandemic. This
reaction is likely due to lower-income groups spending a larger percentage on
necessities, while higher income groups could afford to cut back.

## Education by Income

The effect of lower-income families experiencing more hardship than
higher-income translates to education. While education was matched for all three
income groups before May, the shift to stay-at-home education was dramatic.

In particular, as children in high-income neighborhoods continued to excel in
Math, children of moderate-income neighborhoods recovered in July while
low-income neighborhoods have yet to recover to pre-stay-at-home levels.

# Disparity by Education

The Pandemic has disparately affected different education levels. Our
classification follows the ONET Jobzone classification system.[^10]

[^10]: See Job Zones https://www.onetonline.org/help/online/zones

| Job Zone 1 | Some of these occupations may require a high school diploma or GED certificate.                                                                           | Little or no previous work-related skill, knowledge, or experience is needed for these occupations. For example, a person can become a waiter or waitress even if he/she has never worked before.                                                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Job Zone 2 | These occupations usually require a high school diploma.                                                                                                  | Some previous work-related skill, knowledge, or experience is usually needed. For example, a teller would benefit from experience working directly with the public.                                                                                                                               |
| Job Zone 3 | Most occupations in this zone require training in vocational schools, related on-the-job experience, or an associate's degree.                            | Previous work-related skill, knowledge, or experience is required for these occupations. For example, an electrician must have completed three or four years of apprenticeship or several years of vocational training, and often must have passed a licensing exam, in order to perform the job. |
| Job Zone 4 | Most of these occupations require a four-year bachelor's degree, but some do not.                                                                         | A considerable amount of work-related skill, knowledge, or experience is needed for these occupations. For example, an accountant must complete four years of college and work for several years in accounting to be considered qualified.                                                        |
| Job Zone 5 | Most of these occupations require graduate school. For example, they may require a master's degree, and some require a Ph.D., M.D., or J.D. (law degree). | Extensive skill, knowledge, and experience are needed for these occupations. Many require more than five years of experience. For example, surgeons must complete four years of college and an additional five to seven years of specialized medical training to be able to do their job.         |

We follow TrackTheRecovery's example in combining Job Zone 1 and 2 as 'Low
Level' and the rest as 'High Level.' [^11]

## Job Postings by Education

Interestingly, lower-level job postings recovered faster than higher level
postings. That may be, however, due to lower-income families losing and then
regaining their jobs, while higher-income families were less likely to lose
their jobs.

# Disparity by Industry

The Pandemic disparately impacted businesses. We follow the NAICS classification
system.

## Consumer Spending By Industries

Consumers massively increased spending on Grocery & Food Store in April, and
after that sustaining at around .10%. Other industries faced decreased spending.

As pointed out by the WSJ, 'stuff that we want' has seen an uptick in inflation.
[^12] That category includes food at home, rent at home. Conversely, items such
as shoes, men's suits, and airline fares deflated. Therefore, spending on
industries may overstate shifts in consumer preferences, as prices have also
shifted during the Pandemic. For example, Grocery & Food Store businesses are
earning more in part due to price inflation.
