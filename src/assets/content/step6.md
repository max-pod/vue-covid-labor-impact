## Education by Income

The effect of lower-income families experiencing more hardship than
higher-income translates to education. While education was matched for all three
income groups before May, the shift to stay-at-home education was dramatic.

In particular, as children in high-income neighborhoods continued to excel in
Math, children of moderate-income neighborhoods recovered in July while
low-income neighborhoods have yet to recover to pre-stay-at-home levels.
