## Consumer Spending By Industries

Consumers massively increased spending on Grocery & Food Store in April, and
after that sustaining at around .10%. Other industries faced decreased spending.

As pointed out by the WSJ, 'stuff that we want' has seen an uptick in inflation.
[^12] That category includes food at home, rent at home. Conversely, items such
as shoes, men's suits, and airline fares deflated. Therefore, spending on
industries may overstate shifts in consumer preferences, as prices have also
shifted during the Pandemic. For example, Grocery & Food Store businesses are
earning more in part due to price inflation.
