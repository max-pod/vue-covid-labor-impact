Here is one chart that took me over 10 hours to create and is about ~700 lines of code. It is animated and more pretty on the actual website. It requires a couple more elements before completion.

One small problem I have found is that it took me about 10 hours to create the chart above. Now I'm not a math guy, but that translates to AT LEAST, 7 hours spent on the project.
